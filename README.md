- Hello! My name is **Raphael** and I'm a Computer Science student at Federal University of EspÃ­rito Santo (UFES), currently at the 2Â° semester of a 5-year degree.
- I seriously dig into Data Science, but I'm interested in computer science in general, in topics like AI, computer vision, web development and other stuff.
- Iâ€™m currently learning C, Python, and also learning libraries like Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV. 
- I'd like to be able to contribute and give back to the software community by making open-source products one day.
- You could probably reach me by sending me an email at raphaelsoaresbrasil@hotmail.com.
