# Some info about me 
- Hello! My name is Raphael and I'm a Computer Science student at Federal University of Espírito Santo, currently at the 2° semester of a 5-year degree.
- I seriously dig into Data Science, but I'm interested in computer science in general, in topics like AI, computer vision, web development and oher stuff.
- I’m currently learning C (not my choice), Python, Pandas, NumPy, Django and OpenCV.
- I'd like to be able to contribute and give back to the software community by making open-source products one day.
- You could probably reach me by sending me an email at raphaelsoaresbrasil@hotmail.com.
